# Predictive-Modeling-for-Kidney-Disease-Diagnosis-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to diagnose kidney disease using machine learning techniques. The model is built using a dataset containing 400 patient records, with the aim of classifying whether a patient is diagnosed with kidney disease (1) or not (0).

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a reliable model that can accurately predict kidney disease based on clinical features, thus aiding in early diagnosis and treatment.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Conducted data cleaning, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Normalized and standardized the data for better model performance.
Model Selection:

Implemented several machine learning algorithms:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Generated a classification report and confusion matrix for detailed analysis of model performance.
Visualization:

Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, including histograms and pair plots to understand feature distributions and correlations.
Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 91% with the following metrics:
Precision: 0.95 for Class 0 and 0.90 for Class 1
Recall: 0.92 for Class 0 and 0.88 for Class 1
F1-Score: 0.93 for Class 0 and 0.89 for Class 1
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Data Manipulation: Pandas
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for predicting kidney disease, showcasing the importance of data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation in building effective predictive models. The results indicate that machine learning can play a significant role in early diagnosis and management of kidney-related health issues.
