# Predictive-Modeling-for-Kidney-Disease-Diagnosis-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to diagnose kidney disease using machine learning techniques. The model is built using a dataset containing 400 patient records, with the aim of classifying whether a patient is diagnosed with kidney disease (1) or not (0).
